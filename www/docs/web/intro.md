> ghz-web is in beta state. Please report any issues.

**ghz-web** is a complementary server and a web application for storing, viewing and comparing `ghz` test results.

The basic general idea is that `ghz` would be used to generate JSON report and the JSON report would be ingested using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or [similar tool](https://httpie.org/) to save the results so that they can be stored, viewed, compared, and tracked over time.
